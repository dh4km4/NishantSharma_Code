# Nishant Sharma Prior Code

This repo includes some of my prior coding work throughout different college projects and assignments. 

The Robotics Python folder includes code for a land based surveillance robot project built using ROS. My task was to use an Intel realsense depth camera to detect humans and mark their position on a map created by SLAM. The vision code does this, and the filter code filters out points and clusters areas with concentrated markings of human faces.
