# Nishant Sharma Prior Code

This repo includes some of my prior coding work throughout different college projects and assignments. 

The Robotics Python folder includes code for a land based surveillance robot project built using ROS. My task was to use an Intel realsense depth camera to detect humans and mark their position on a map created by SLAM. The vision code does this, and the filter code filters out points and clusters areas with concentrated markings of human faces. 

Multi-threaded cpp includes a C++ program developed in an advanced program technique class, which solves a problem using Multi-threading. 

The Embedded folder includes C programming on an LPC microcontroller (ARM mbed). The microcontroller was used as a multi-use device which could be bluetooth controlled to play different audios, display different images from an SD card on an LCD, and light different LED bulbs. RTOS was utilized for multi-threading. 

GPU acceleration includes a CUDA file which uses NVIDIA gpus from a server to accelerate a particular physics problem which calculates how long it takes for heat to travel through a thin metal sheet.
